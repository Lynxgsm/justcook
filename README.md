It is a simple demo project using Flutter and Tensorflow demonstrated during DevFest Antananarivo 2019.

## Getting Started

Just clone the project, and (if necessary) launch `flutter packages get` to get all packages needed for the app.

I assume that code structure is not as optimized as it should be.

## How to

In order to get this app running on your computer, you should have <b>python 3.X</b>.

- Open the project and change the variable <i>urlBase</i> from `lib/src/constants/urls.dart` to your IP
- Open the `api` folder on a command line and use `python3 api.py` to run api server using <b>Flask</b>
- Finally, launch your project on a device (virtual or physical) using `flutter run`
